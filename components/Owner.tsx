          German Perez is the proud owner of Cuba Bakery, a family-run
          establishment that has been a cornerstone of the Homestead community
          since 1972. As a second-generation entrepreneur, German carries on the
          legacy started by his father, preserving the authentic Cuban flavors
          and traditions that have made Cuba Bakery a local favorite for over 50
          years. With a deep passion for quality and craftsmanship, he ensures
          that every pastry, loaf of bread, and cup of coffee reflects the
          dedication and heritage of his family&#39;s business. Under his
          leadership, Cuba Bakery continues to be a welcoming place where
          customers can enjoy the taste of Cuba, one bite at a time.
